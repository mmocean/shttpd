.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTIONS
.Op Ar config_file
.Nm
.Fl A Ar htpasswd_file realm username password
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is small, fast and easy to use web server with CGI, SSL, Digest Authorization
support. It can be run as stand-alone server, be managed by
.Xr inetd 8
, or be embedded into existing C/C++ application.
.Pp
Unlike other web servers,
.Nm
does not expect CGI scirpts to be put in a special directory. They may be
anywhere. CGI files are recognized by an extension, which is
.Dq .cgi
by default.
.Pp
SSI files are also recognized by extension. Currently, the only SSI directive
supported is `<!--#include "url-encoded-path" -->'
, where `path' can be relative to
.Nm
working directory, or absolute system path. In the embedded mode, more
directives are available: #call, #if/#elif/#endif/#else/#endif.
.Pp
It is possible to specify multiple ports to listen on. For example, to
make
.Nm
listen on HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443, one should start it as
.Dq shttpd -s cert.pem -p 80,443s
.Pp
.Nm
can take configuration parameters from two sources: from the command
line and from the configuration file. Command line parameters have
higher priority. Every command line parameter has associated configuration
file keyword, except
.Fl A
parameter.
In the configuration file, blank lines and lines started with
.Dq #
character are ignored. All other lines must start with the keyword
followed by a whitespace followed by keyword's value.
If both command line parameter and configuration
file option are not specified, the default value is taken. The configuration
file may not be present at all.
.Pp
If
.Nm
should be managed by
.Xr inetd 8 ,
add this line to
.Pa inetd.conf :
.Pp
.Dl http stream tcp nowait nobody /path/to/shttpd shttpd -I1 -d /my/www
.Pp
